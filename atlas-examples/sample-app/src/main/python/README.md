# Python Sample App

This is a Python sample app to showcase basic functionality of Atlas. We are using Python client
to call Atlas APIs. Make sure to install Atlas Python client first before trying to run this project. Currently, compatible with Python 3.5+

## Installation

1. Using `setup.py`

```bash
cd <atlas_directory>/atlas-examples/sample-app/src/main/python

# To check if apache-atlas client is installed try the following command
python3
>>> import apache_atlas
>>>

# If there is no error, then client is installed otherwise follow client Readme file to install it first.
```


To Run this project

```bash
python sample_client.py
```
This will prompt for url of the Atlas server, username and password.

Introduction
  This feature takes care while in some cases it is possible that during entity creation, the entity is stored in the data store, but the corresponding indexes are not created in Solr.
  Since Atlas relies heavily on Solr in the operation of its Basic Search, this will result in entity not being returned by a search.

Steps to execute repair index in Atlas :
  If the user needs to restore all the indexes, this can be accomplished by executing the repair-index.py with no command-line parameters.
  To perform selective restore for an Atlas entity, specify the GUID of that entity:
  eg : atlas-index-repair/repair_index.py [-g <guid>]
  For kerberos as authentication mode :
  use: kinit -kt <keytab directory>/atlas.keytab atlas/fqdn@DOMAIN.
  Add "-Djava.security.auth.login.config=/<atlas server directory>/conf/atlas_jaas.conf" to DEFAULT_JVM_OPTS in repair_index.py.
